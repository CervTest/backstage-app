Ran the following to start (with `nodenv` previously installed - other managers are available):

* `nodenv install 20.10.0`
* `nodenv local 20.10.0` (did not catch Yarn)
* `nodenv global 20.10.0` (setting it globally was suggested, didn't help either)
* `npm install -g yarn` (to get Yarn for v20 rather than just existing v16 - but globally hmm)
* `npx @backstage/create-app@latest` for latest Backstage (in subdir with a given name, move after)
* `yarn dev` should now work (prior step included the `yarn install`)
* Figured out a working Jenkinsfile with publishing
*** Tried copying over all changes from proto-backstage which broke (and leaked secrets). undid back to commit 4 - later changes noted further down
* Added minimal utility from Adaptavist Flavored Backstage v1, keeping v2 out for now



*** Rolled back changes (other than local NPM prep maybe?)

* Copied over files from proto-backstage 
* Redid the Soundcheck plugin install steps (yarn only - files already present)
  * yarn workspace backend add @spotify/backstage-plugin-soundcheck-backend
  * yarn workspace app add @spotify/backstage-plugin-soundcheck
* Realized that, oh yeah, new front/back end bits, need up update some stuff
  * The authMiddleware.ts stuff had changed, deleted the old file, replaced with instructions from https://github.com/backstage/backstage/blob/master/contrib/docs/tutorials/authenticate-api-requests.md
  * Added authMiddlewareFactory.ts instead 
  * Ran `yarn add --cwd packages/backend cookie-parser @types/cookie-parser`
  *
