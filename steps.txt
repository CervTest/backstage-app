Ran the following to start (with `nodenv` previously installed - other managers are available):

* `nodenv install 20.10.0`
* `nodenv local 20.10.0` (did not catch Yarn)
* `nodenv global 20.10.0` (setting it globally was suggested, didn't help either)
* `npm install -g yarn` (to get Yarn for v20 rather than just existing v16 - but globally hmm)
* `npx @backstage/create-app@latest` for latest Backstage (in subdir with a given name, move after)
* `yarn dev` should now work (prior step included the `yarn install`)
